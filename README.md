## Prerequites

Ensure you have the following environment variables:
- APP_OPENAI_API_KEY, create an account on [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com) to get your API key
- APP_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN, create an account on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) to get your API key
- APP_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY, create an account on [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) to get your API key
- APP_GCP_PROJECT_ID, it is the ID of your project in Google Cloud Platform(https://cloud.google.com/?hl=en)
- APP_VERTEXAI_LOCATION, use a geographic location that is compatible with Vertex AI (I'm using us-central1)

Make sure to login in GCP with the command:
```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```
This will allow the backend running inside the Docker container to use these credentials to authenticate with Google Cloud Services.

## Use docker-compose to run the project 

Ensure that you have both Docker and docker-compose installed on your system. I'm using Builtkit in the backend Dockerfile. Therefore, you must activate the corresponding environment variables to build the Docker images.
 ```sh
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
```  

To start the application, simply run:
 ```sh
make dc-up
```
